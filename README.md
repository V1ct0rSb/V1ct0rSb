# Hello, I'm Victor Barreto 👋

<br>

I am a graduate with a degree in **Information Systems** from Universidade Tiradentes (UNIT), now seeking my first opportunity as a **Junior Backend Developer**, with a focus on **Java and Spring Boot**.  
While my primary focus is on the backend, I also have a passion for frontend development and enjoy creating engaging visual experiences. Because of this, I can definitely see myself growing into a **Fullstack Developer** role.

I am committed to continuous learning, applying best practices, and sharing my work. In every project, I strive to write clean code, implement solid architecture, and ensure high performance.

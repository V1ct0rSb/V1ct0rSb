# Hello, I'm Victor Barreto 👋

<br>

As an Information Systems graduate from Universidade Tiradentes (UNIT), my focus is on Backend development using Java and Spring Boot.
While my primary focus is the backend, I am also passionate about frontend development and enjoy creating engaging visual experiences. This blend of interests fuels my ambition to grow into a Fullstack Developer role.
I am committed to continuous learning, applying best practices, and sharing knowledge with my team. In every project, I strive to write clean code, build solid architecture, and ensure high performance.
